# Neumorphism Login Page

Welcome to my Neumorphism Login Page project! I created this for fun while experimenting with the Neumorphism design trend. It's a simple login page with a modern twist, featuring dynamic shadows and OAuth integration.

## Project Overview

This project showcases a login page designed with Neumorphism, a design style that combines soft shadows and highlights to create a 3D effect. The page includes:

- **Dynamic Shadows**: The shadow around the login panel changes based on mouse movement, simulating a light source effect.
- **OAuth Buttons**: Functional buttons for logging in with popular services like Facebook, Google, GitHub, and X.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and looks great on different screen sizes.

## Technical Details

- **HTML & CSS**: The structure and styling are done using HTML and CSS, with a focus on Neumorphism design principles.
- **JavaScript**: Used to track mouse movements and dynamically update the shadow effect.
- **Vite**: The project is set up with Vite for a fast development experience.
- **OAuth Integration**: Placeholder functions for OAuth login, ready to be connected to actual authentication services.

## Future Improvements

- **Complete OAuth Integration**: Connect the OAuth buttons to real authentication services.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improve accessibility features for a better user experience.

Feel free to explore and modify the project. I hope you enjoy playing around with Neumorphism as much as I did!
